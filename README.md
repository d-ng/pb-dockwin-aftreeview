# pb-dockwin-aftreeview
A docking window add-in to PI ProcessBook with the AFTreeView window forms and other UI components. Whenever a node of the treeview is double-clicked, the respective display will open (based on the element name); if the file path is empty, a new ProcessBook display will be opened.

## Getting Started
You can obtain the Visual Studio 2013 solution and the associated files from the repository. This project contains references to OSIsoft.PBObjLib.dll, OSIsoft.PBSymLib.dll, OSIsoft.AFSDK.dll, and OSIsoft.AF.UI.dll, which are available in the GAC once PI ProcessBook and PI AF Client are installed. The code was tested with PI ProcessBook 2014 and PI AF SDK 2.6.2.
